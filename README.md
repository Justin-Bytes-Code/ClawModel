# ClawModel
 
This is a NON CODING RELATED SCHOOL PROJECT. This project is to show my proficiency with all aspects of game development specifically the art side and implementing 3d artwork inside of a game. 

I was tasked with a couple of things: 

1. Draw a concept art piece for art that you plan to use. 
2. Using that concept art create a 3d model in 3DSMAX using Autodesk. 
3. Create an animation for it inside 3DSMAX using Autodesk. 
4. Implement the model into a game. (I have not linked the game I used this model for but I plan to in the future.)
